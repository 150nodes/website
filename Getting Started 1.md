## Getting Started:

Some of the tools we use may be new to you. That's ok! 

This handbook will guide you through the basics of getting started with the tools we use such as Basecamp, GitHub, and Zoom.

### Basecamp:

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/welcome-back_) is a simple project management software that keeps everything in one place. All communication related to the business, tasks, events and files related to the project  . It is available in [mobile and desktop apps,](https://basecamp.com/via) but the browser version will work just fine as well.  Once you've created an account and accepted the invite, you should be ready to get started on Basecamp.


### Github:

GitHub will be mainly used by programmers to review and discuss changes to code. We are also trying it out for writing, right now!  

If you're new, we recommend installing [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), as well as [Typora](https://typora.io/) for editing Markdown.

### Zoom:

For 'face-to-face' meetings, we will be using Zoom. Similar to applications such as Skype, it is used for both group and 1 on 1 calls. 
[Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/support/download) and create an account (if you haven't already).
