## Getting Started:

Some of the tools we use may be new to you. That's ok! 

This handbook will guide you through the basics of getting started with the tools we use such as Basecamp, GitHub, and Zoom.

### Basecamp:

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/welcome-back_) is a simple project management software that keeps everything in one place. All communication related to the business, tasks, events and files related to the project  . It is available in [mobile and desktop apps,](https://basecamp.com/via) but the browser version will work just fine as well.  Once you've created an account and accepted the invite, you should be ready to get started on Basecamp.


### Github:

GitHub will be mainly used by programmers to review and discuss changes to code. We are also trying it out for writing, right now!  

If you're new, we recommend installing [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), as well as [Typora](https://typora.io/) for editing Markdown.

##### Github basics:

- Once the GitHub desktopp app is installed and you're ready to add or change files, you'll want to first clone the 150nodes repository. (File > Clone Repository > 150nodes/website).
- Create a new branch for your edits (Branch > New Branch).
- From there, you can view all the files in the repository in explorer, or open the repository files in your external editor (such as Typora).
- Once you've made and saved your desired changes such as adding or modifying files, you'll be able to click the "commit" button at the bottom left to commit the changes to your new branch.
- Push your commits to GitHub (Repository > Push), and create a pull request through the app or the GitHub website. After this, your changes should be ready to be reviewed.



### Zoom:

For 'face-to-face' meetings, we will be using Zoom. Similar to applications such as Skype, it is used for both group and 1 on 1 calls. 
[Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/support/download) and create an account (if you haven't already).
