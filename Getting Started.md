**Getting Started:**

Some of the tools we use may be new to you. That's ok! 

This handbook will guide you through the basics of getting started with the tools we use such as Basecamp, GitHub, and Zoom.



<u>Basecamp:</u>

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/welcome-back_) is a simple project management software that keeps everything in one place. Communication, tasks, events, (what else?) . It is available in [mobile and desktop apps,](https://basecamp.com/via) but the browser version will work just fine as well. (Do we use this rather than email?) Once you've created an account and accepted the invite, you should be ready to get started on Basecamp.



<u>Github:</u>

(difficult to describe what it does/is for as I'm still quite new to it). 

If you're new, we recommend installing [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). (will other people need typora as well? I can include a bit/link to that as well)

(Guide on how to use it, I'll probably have to do it once more with this file before I can write on how to do it)



<u>Zoom:</u>

For 'face-to-face' meetings, we will be using Zoom. Similar to applications such as Skype, it is used for both group and 1 on 1 calls. (is there anything else they really need to know)

[Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/support/download) and create an account (if you haven't already). (is there someone they should add? Justin?)
