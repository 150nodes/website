# What are you currently building?

Currently we are building a website for antique collectors to replace this (website)[3].

# How we work
We work in a distributed fashion, where, when and how we like.

- No office, work wherever you get your best work done
- No set work hours (but employees working closely together should be close to the same timezone)
- We work [asynchronously](2) to avoid interrupting each other
- Written communication over voice chat and instant messages
- When written communication fails resort to a short meeting

# Who we work with

All work relationships at 150N are win-win, both parties get something out of collaborating.

# What does 150N stand for?

150 is a reference to [Dunbar's number](1), the maximum number of humans that can co-operate without the need for too much hierarchy.

The "N" could mean many things: Noodles in a bowl, Ninjas in a dojo, Nuts in a shell.
