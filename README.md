### What are we currently building?

We are currently building a simple, free framework for antique collectors to create their own website similar to [TuckDB](https://tuckdbpostcards.org).

### How do we work?
- We work as a distributed team.

* We work online - from home, from a coffee shop - there is no office.

- We work at whatever time of day suits us best - there are deadlines, of course.
- We work [asynchronously](2) to avoid interrupting each other; sometimes we have meetings.
- We communicate in writing, only resorting to instant messaging or voice chat when needed.
- We work only with people whom we can collaborate with for life.

### Why Estonia?

In [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Residency_of_Estonia) Estonia launched its [eResidency program](https://e-resident.gov.ee/), allowing any non-Estonian to easily start a software company. In addition, the accounting firm [Xolo](https://www.xolo.io/) makes company management a breeze.

### What does 150N stand for?

150 is a reference to [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), the maximum number of humans that can co-operate without the need for too much hierarchy.

The "N" can mean many things: noodles in a bowl, ninjas in a dojo, nuts in a shell.
